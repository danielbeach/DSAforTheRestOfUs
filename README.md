# DSAforTheRestOfUs
Introduction to DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) with Rust.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase at a very high level, DSA for someone who's brand
new to the topic. Not a very indepth look, but a very high level one, allowing someone
with little to no background in DSA to understand at least something about the different
DSA topics, and set them on a course of learning.
